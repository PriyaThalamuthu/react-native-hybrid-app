# ChuckNorrisViewer
- ChuckNorrisViewer (ReactNative + Redux + RxJs)
- A sample code of React Native - Native Hybrid application

![img](./img/img1.png)

# Note
- master branch is a very basic implementation of the hybrid application. If you would like to see a real world code, switch a branch to 'react_service_architecture'. This branch showcases a practical hybrid application using Dagger2 for DI and RxJava2 for creating Observer Pattern.  ã€€
- Currently this hybrid application only works for Android version. iOS version will come in shortly.

# Setup and run

```
npm install
react-native run-ios
react-native run-android (Launch emulator beforehand)
```
